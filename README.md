# PROTOTYPES: Flexiformal Definiton Expansion

This repository contains prototype implementations of flexiformal definition expansion (i.e. replacing a term in a text through its definition while automatically adapting syntax and preserving semantics) and other relocalization methods.

* [sTeX prototype](https://github.com/10S1/definitionexpansion/tree/main/sTeX): GF RGL-based definition expansion of sTeX content.
* [sHTML prototype](https://github.com/10S1/definitionexpansion/tree/main/sHTML): GF RGL-based definition expansion of FTML content (formerly called sHTML).
* [CNL prototype](https://github.com/10S1/definitionexpansion/tree/main/cnltransforms): Definition expansion and recontextualization of FTML content using GF-based CNL.
