2. Install `python` and the libraries `pgf`, `nltk` and `lxml`.
3. Clone this repository
4. Run `python -m cnltransforms.controller pushout1` in the root directory of the repository to process the running example from the paper.
5. Open `/tmp/cnltransform-logs/pushout1.html` in your browser to see a what happend during the transformation.
